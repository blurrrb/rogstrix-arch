# rogstrix-arch
*This script utilizes the archinstall library to construct an opinionated arch setup.*

I sometimes like to experiment with new distros (distro-hopping) but always come back to arch. This repository will be meant for my configurations (not many since I like to keep things vanilla) and installer script specifically for my rogstrix laptop.

This is in no way a general purpose script. This script sets up my laptop the way I like it to be. Though, feel free to hack around the script and suit it to your needs.
